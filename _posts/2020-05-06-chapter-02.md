<h2>Dismissing Religion</h2>

Let's deal with the most ridiculous consideration first, shall we? Single priests promoting coupling is about as fucked up as it gets. We could go through the history of Christianity (as an example) and look how the religious texts and historical examples are full of dysfunctional relationships, but we do not want our emphasis to shift to what is broken. The central relationship of the Christmas story - and Christianity more generally - is a fellow being cuckolded by his betrothed with an omnipotent being. Religion is not placed to promote a specific form of relationship, when it epitomizes in both theory and practice the greatest flaws of the human character.

Being not qualified to promote relationships more generally, religion is also not qualified to promote specific dynamics and lifestyles, be they monogamous, heterosexual or otherwise. 

<h2>Religion as a Social Weapon</h2>

Religion is a system of power and is used within social contexts to promote norms. Anything else to discuss about the use of religion to force and enforce coupling norms can be examined within wider social discussions.
