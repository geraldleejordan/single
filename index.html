<p>I have known both single and coupled life. I have bought into the cultural propaganda about the benefits of being with another and I have come out the other side to realize that the best life is the single one. This book is an attempt to share this good news with those long single, those newly single and those wishing they were single. If you are in that “honeymoon” period with a partner, close this book and go back to your ignorant bliss. You can pick it up again in a few years, when your life is different.</p>

<p>For those of you to whom I am writing - welcome to the good life! You no longer need feel that you are somehow inadequate due to a cultural paradigm meant to promote procreation and social cohesion in cultures which do not encourage self-actualization.</p>

<p>You are evolving to be your best selves and you have taken the next step. Sit back and let’s explore the good life together.</p>
